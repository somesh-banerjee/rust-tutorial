# Learning Rust

This repository contains rust programs for too many linked list that I have written while learning Rust. The programs are based on the book [Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/).

### How to run the programs

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Notes for self

- Revisit lifetime in Rust
- Arc for thread safety is not clear, probably will not be used in common use cases
